Opilionology is one of the arachnological branches where Latin America stands out as a global leader in scientific knowledge production. In this symposium, outstanding research currently conducted by talented young arachnologists will be presented. Topics will include behavior, sexual selection, faunistics, functional diversity, biodiversity, taxonomy, phylogenetic systematics, phylogenomics, state-of-the-art methodological approaches, among others. This space aims to not only represent the quality of the topics but also reflect the wide diversity of young speakers in this field and how their work, in some cases, has transcended continental borders, positioning Latin American arachnology at a global level.
