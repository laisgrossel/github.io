The use of alcohol gel for hand antisepsis and surface disinfection became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed the physicochemical properties and microbiological efficacy of various gel alcohol brands sold in pharmacies. Tests included alcohol content, color, appearance, pH, and centrifugation resistance. A disinfection test against Salmonella typhimurium was also performed. All samples met expected physicochemical standards and were effective in eliminating bacteria on contaminated surfaces.
