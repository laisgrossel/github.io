This study investigated whether body size in Mustelidae species is influenced by diet, habitat structure, or environmental temperature. Using phylogenetic regressions across 53 species, results showed that body size evolution was not related to diet or temperature, but was significantly associated with habitat. Semi-aquatic species were larger, possibly due to thermal inertia, predation pressure, resource availability, or bone density. The findings highlight the role of habitat in shaping body size at lower taxonomic levels.
