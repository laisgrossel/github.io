title: "8. Effects of nest-site availability on male–male mompetition and the foraging costs of egg attendance in an arachnid with exclusive paternal care"

excerpt: 'We investigated how nest availability influences male–male competition and foraging costs in the harvestman Magnispina neptunus. Males defend natural cavities as oviposition sites and provide exclusive parental care. Our study found that larger males were more likely to hold nests, and nest opening size influenced nest ownership. Results suggest that prior residency may be more important than body size in nest possession. We highlight the role of external factors, like cavity size, in nest defensibility for resource-defense mating systems.'
