This study aimed to propose preventive measures against zoonoses caused by stray dogs in the Faxinal neighborhood of Mafra–SC. Fieldwork identified the presence of dogs, probable zoonoses, and their impact on residents. Interviews and surveys showed limited awareness of zoonoses and that not all street dogs are abandoned. An action-based campaign distributed informative materials to the community. The project promoted public awareness and animal welfare, contributing to improved health for both dogs and humans.
