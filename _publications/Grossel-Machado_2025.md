title: "9. Female mate choice in an arachnid with exclusive paternal care: males in good condition have higher mating success, but only if they can advertise it"

excerpt: 'In this work, we tested the essential male care model in Iporangaia pustulosa, a harvestman with exclusive paternal care. Using a field experiment, we manipulated males body condition and gland status (pheromone-releasing or blocked). Well-fed males with unblocked glands received more eggs and had higher fitness. Our results suggest that sexual advertisement is condition-dependent and enhances male attractiveness, supporting the model predictions and highlighting the link between body condition, pheromones, and mating success.'
