This study examined how the dominance hierarchy of white-lipped peccary males responded to the death of the alpha. After the disturbance, the hierarchy became unstable but showed resilience. A new dominant emerged through increased agonistic and affiliative behaviors. Social dynamics primarily shaped the new order, though individual attributes like weight, testicle size, and testosterone levels also played a role. Findings support both the Social Dynamics and Previous Attributes hypotheses in the restructuring of dominance hierarchies.
