This study reports the first possible case of Balantioides coli infection in white-lipped peccaries in Brazil. Thirteen fecal samples from animals at Curitiba’s Municipal Zoo tested positive for Ciliophora parasites resembling B. coli. Despite the absence of clinical signs, the peccaries may act as reservoirs, raising concerns due to their close contact with humans in subsistence farming. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring this zoonotic parasite and its potential public health implications.
