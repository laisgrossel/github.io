The Summer Course in Zoology (CVZoo) at the University of São Paulo aims to train new researchers and update teachers, addressing the imbalance in zoological research in Brazil. Surveys of participants over ten years revealed positive impacts on their academic and professional development. CVZoo effectively promotes zoology nationwide, decentralizing knowledge and fostering more equitable access to education and research opportunities in the field.
