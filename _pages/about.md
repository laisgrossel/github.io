Hello!
I am a Brazilian behavioural ecologist interested in Animal Behaviour, including sexual selection, parental care and social behaviour. Currently, I am doing my PhD at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and using harvestmen (Arthropoda: Opiliones) as model of study to answer how sexual selection can explain the existence of parental care. I have been working in scientific projects involving field experiments, social networks, molecular and bioinformatic tools, phylogenetic comparative methods and data science. I also had some experience teaching Sciences in Basic Education, and contributed to assist classes for graduation. 

Feel free to contact me for any question of request.
